This code was used to create the sound-maps for the masters-thesis "Methods in Audio-Cartograpy" at FH Vorarlberg (Austria) by Robert Oetting. 
It only works on linux. For use on other plattforms, the dataread-class needs to be changed to work on other systems. 
The code in ofApp is messy and redundant. It was created by constantly modifying and adding functions in order to explore the possibilities of sound-mapping.
Because of this circular workflow, it was possible to explore a big range of different soundmapping- methods in relatively little time at the cost of usability.
The classes for audio analysis and data-preperation are relatively clean and reusable.
